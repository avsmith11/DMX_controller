## Overall Design

The FPGA system is responsible for receiving SPI data from the MCU and displaying this data on a 16x2 LCD display. This SPI data contains the DMX parameter number and the current value of the most recently changed parameter. The FPGA then uses a combination of different modules and finite state machines to implement the [LCD protocol](https://electronicsforu.com/technology-trends/learn-electronics/16x2-lcd-pinout-diagram) and display the SPI data visually on the screen. This design was adapted from a previous [E155 Project by Declan Oâ€™Neill and Kip Macsai-Goren](https://doneill890.github.io/slide-whistle/)Below is the HDL block diagram.
