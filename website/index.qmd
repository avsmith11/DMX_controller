## Abstract
DMX is a digital control standard used for lighting and effects commonly used in theatre and concerts. One of the key facets of DMX is that its topology includes just one daisy-chained signal. Instruments connected to the signal are assigned an address and pick out their respective parts of the modified UART signal. We designed a simple live DMX controller that allows a user to control the movement, brightness, color, pattern, and strobe of [these moving lights](https://www.uking-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZQ-B147.pdf) with tactile analog sliders and display the most recent changed parameter on an LCD. Though, it would work just as well for any DMX light. This project involved a dive into the DMX protocol or [ANSI E1.11](https://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/docs/ANSI%20E1.11%20-%202024.pdf), the [LCD protocol](https://electronicsforu.com/technology-trends/learn-electronics/16x2-lcd-pinout-diagram), and several peripherals on the MCU including the ADC, UART, and SPI. The Implementation as of the project check-off included two 10-segment displays to stand in for the LCD due to time constraints on debugging. This portfolio contains a successful simulation of the LCD control module.
