You do not need to cover nitty gritty details like state transition or output logic tables.\n\nAn MCU design page\n\nA brief summary of what the MCU does\nAny diagrams needed to explain the flow of the MCU code\n\nResults\n\nA discussion of the overall performance of the final system\nAny relevant simulation results or oscilloscope traces\nVideos or photos of the final project or any intermediate build steps.\n\nTeam\n\nA list of the team members with a one sentence bio and links to any relevant personal websites or social media presence.

You can directly paste the embed HTML code into your Quarto markdown.\nThink of your front page like a pitch. You’re looking to give the reader a quick summary of what your project is and invite them to check it out in more detail.\nHost the portfolio website using Github pages. The most seamless way is to keep all the Quarto source docs inside a docs folder of your project Github repository and run quarto publish from there to render to Github pages. As a reminder, instructions on how to render can be found here."
